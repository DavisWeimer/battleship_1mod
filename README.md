# Written reflection:
## In your README reflect on the following:

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

We decided to read through the full iteration guidelines from top to bottom. After reading that we could tell it was designed to be sequential. We took note of any potential challenges. As for the lack of interaction pattern, we built that by going through and testing things in pry to see the result. It was difficult without TDD.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

Iteration 4. It would have been nice to have a smarter computer. Also **MORE** ascii art!

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We chose to do a lot of driver/navigator pair programming. This allowed us to work on the harder components together which proved to be a great learning experience for both of us.



4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Since we chose to pair program for a majority of the project, we were able to give each other immediate feedback.
